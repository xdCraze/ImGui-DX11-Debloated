\# ImGui DX11 Debloated \*(kinda)\*



I didn't like how everything in ImGui's example was located in the `main.cpp` file and I felt like there was unnecessary stuff so I decided to make this. I'm not saying you have to use it or it's better than the ImGui example, I'm just putting it here so I don't forget about it.
